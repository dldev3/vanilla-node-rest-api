        "description":"A stranger could drive through Miguel Street and just say 'Slum!' because he could see no more. But to its residents this derelict corner of Trinidad's capital is a complete world, where everybody is quite different from everybody else. There is Popo the carpenter, who neglects his livelihood to build the thing without a name. There is Man-man, who goes from running for public office to staging his own crucifixion, and the dreaded Big Foot, the bully with glass tear ducts. There is the lovely Mrs. Hereira, in thrall to her monstrous husband. In this tender, funny early novel, V. S. Naipaul renders their lives (and the legends their neighbors construct around them) with Dickensian verve and Chekhovian compassion.Set during World War II and narrated by an unnamed-but precociously observant-neighborhood boy, Miguel Street is a work of mercurial mood shifts, by turns sweetly melancholy and anarchically funny. It overflows with life on every page.",
